# RHCSA-study
Study notes that I am taking for the exam. Using the Sander van Vugt videos and books.
<h3>The beginning:</h3>
<p>I'm starting these notes after I'm already a quarter of the way into the material. I'm finding that most of the information from the Sander van Vugt videos is a review. I'm following along using a Rocky Linux sandbox but will later install my own Red Hat Linux machine. I have also started reading the RHEL book to make sure that I'm really understanding the concepts.</p>
